# KmapSolver
A 2, 3, and 4 variable K-map solver.

## Objective
A univeristy project that aims at familiarizing the students with the use of k-maps and simplifying boolean expressions. 

## Course Info
1. Course Name: Digital Design I
2. Instructor: Professor Mona Farouk 

## Compiling on Visual Studio
NOTE: I haven't been able to update the project on Visual Studio so you might need to configure the solution manually.

* Clone the repository on your PC.
* Open the solution file as it is already configuired properly to work with any paths.
* Make sure that you put the 'Thirdparty' folder at the same level as the solution directory
* Compiling would not be an issue at that time.
* Make sure to compile at the x32 (x86) architecture since the SFML library is linked for that architecture only.
* If you have any problems with the SFML library, check out the offical page of SFML: https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php or contact me at: Seif_Sallam@aucegypt.edu


## Compiling on Linux

The project has a Makefile inside it that compiles the proejct correctly and places the output inside the directory `./KMapSolver/Build/`
